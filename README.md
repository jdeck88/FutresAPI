# FutresAPI

Run the fetch.py command to fetch data from GEOME and it will populate
JSON files in the data directory.  This repository populates lookup lists using the fetch.py 
script.  It also populates the elasticsearch backend database using the loader.py script.

The FuTRES dynamic data is hosted by the plantphenology nodejs proxy service at:
https://github.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-server/blob/master/docs/es_futres_proxy.md
